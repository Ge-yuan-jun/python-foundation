1. Syntax error
2. Runtime error
  - the error does not appear until you run the program. These errors are also called exceptions because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.
3. Semantic error
  - If there is a semantic error in your program, it will run successfully in the sense that the computer will not generate any error messages
